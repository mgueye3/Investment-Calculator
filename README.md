# Investment Calculator

## Description
This Python script calculates the **future investment value** using compound interest based on:
- The **initial investment amount**.
- The **annual interest rate** (in percentage).
- The **number of years** the investment is held.

This project is useful for understanding **financial calculations and Python scripting**, essential for a **Software Development Apprentice**.

## Features
- Computes **future value** using compound interest.
- Accepts **user input dynamically**.
- Implements **error handling** for invalid inputs.
- Displays results in a **formatted output**.

## How to Use
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Enter the required values:
   - Investment amount.
   - Annual interest rate (%).
   - Number of years.
3. The program will display the **future investment value**.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/investment_calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd investment_calculator
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python investment_calculator.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for **different compounding periods** (e.g., quarterly, daily).
- Implement a **graphical user interface (GUI)** using Tkinter.
- Provide **investment growth visualization** using Matplotlib.

## Relevance to Software Development Apprenticeship
- Demonstrates **Python programming and financial computation**.
- Reinforces **user input validation and exception handling**.
- Strengthens understanding of **compound interest calculations**.
